# HTML-CSS-capstone
Microverse HTML and CSS Week 4 Project
>In this project, I built a website made up of three webpages, the main page, list of items and detail page. All three pages are responsive to desktop, tablet and mobile screen sizes. This project helps us practise our skills on float, flex, grid, bootstrap framework. This project has the following technical objectives:

- Use semantic HTML tags
- Use CSS selectors correctly
- Use CSS box model
- Use industry-standard tools (flexbox) to place   elements in the page
- Ability to create UIs adaptable to different screen sizes using mediaqueries
- Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap
- Apply front-end best practices
- Create UIs adjusted to given designs 

> The non technical skills objectives of this project include:
- Communicate with strong English written and verbal
- Communicate information effectively to technical and non-technical people
- Translate business requirements into software solutions
- Work well in a fast-paced environment under deadlines in a changing environment
- Perform tasks and complete projects with minimal supervision
>By applying best practices related to repositories and front-end code. We created interfaces (UIs) that will adapt to different devices (screen size).
